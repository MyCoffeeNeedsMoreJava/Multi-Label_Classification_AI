# Multi-Label_Classification_AI
Deep Learning Project about building, training and validating a Multi-Label Classification AI

This AI is built on the ResNet50V2 model. Implemented in Google Colab (Python), utilizing Keras as our AI framework.
The output layers are added to make sure the model is trained to find a multi-label classification of the data-set.
The following picture is the model of the AI:

The code is written with google drive cooperation, and will therefore have some empty spots marked with #FILL, where sensitive information used to be (i.e E-mails, drive accounts, etc)

The data set will not be included in this repository due to the required space of 300.000 images, but the categories can be seen on the diagram below:

The image above shows the successrate of a correct classification of the AI on the dataset, together with the available labels.
On the right it shows the accuracy chart on a percent basis (i.e 0.8 = 80%), which indicates the amount of times it correctly guessed the label of an image.
