# Multi-Label_Classification_AI
Deep Learning Project about building, training and validating a Multi-Label Classification AI

This AI is built on the ResNet50V2 model. Implemented in Google Colab (Python), utilizing Keras as our AI framework.
The output layers are added to make sure the model is trained to find a multi-label classification of the data-set.
The data set will not be included in this repository due to the required space of 300.000 images, but the categories can be seen on the diagram below:
